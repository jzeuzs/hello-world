                        <p>
                                PHP is a general-purpose scripting language
                                especially suited to web development. It was
                                originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
                                Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference
                                implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
                                PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but
                                it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP:
                                Hypertext Preprocessor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                PHP code is usually processed on a web server by
                                a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a
                                daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
                                executable. On a web server, the result of the
                                interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be
                                any type of data, such as generated HTML or
                                binary image data – would form the whole or part
                                of an HTTP response. Various web template
                                systems, web content management systems, and web
                                frameworks exist which can be employed to
                                orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that
                                response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many
                                programming tasks outside of the web context,
                                such as standalone graphical applications and
                                robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can
                                also be interpreted and executed via
                                command-line interface (CLI).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the
                                Zend Engine, is free software released under the
                                PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can
                                be deployed on most web servers on almost every
                                operating system and platform, free of charge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The PHP language evolved without a written
                                formal specification or standard until 2014,
                                with the original implementation acting as the
                                de facto standard which other implementations
                                aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to
                                create a formal PHP specification.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use
                                discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or
                                lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP
                                Development Team. A large additional fraction
                                uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6,
                                2021) "supported for critical security issues
                                only." Over 40% of all PHP websites use version
                                5.6 or older, that not even Debian supports
                                (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).
